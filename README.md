# Country GDP per Capita Prediction

## Overview

This project investigates a comprehensive dataset containing information on the population, region, area size, mortality, and more of 227 countries. The primary focus is on identifying and modeling the factors that affect a country's GDP per capita. By leveraging the rich dataset, the goal is to build a predictive model that can provide insights into the economic performance of different nations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises data points for 227 countries, covering a range of socio-economic indicators. Some of the key features include:

- Population
- Region
- Area Size
- Mortality Rates
- Economic Indicators

The dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis and modeling process.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.

2. **Feature Selection:** Identify key features that significantly influence a country's GDP per capita.

3. **Model Development:** Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast GDP per capita.

4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance and interpret the significance of various features in predicting GDP per capita.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach, including:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Development and Training
- Model Evaluation

## Results

The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing GDP per capita and offer a predictive model capable of estimating a country's economic performance based on the provided features.
